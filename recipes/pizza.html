    <h2>Desciption</h2>
    <p>A pizza is a dish typically made from dough that is flattened and topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and various other ingredients such as vegetables, meats, and herbs. The dough is then baked in an oven until the crust is crispy and the cheese is melted. Pizzas can come in many different varieties and can be made with a wide range of toppings, including pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, and peppers. The most common type of pizza is the Margherita, which is typically made with tomato, mozzarella, and basil.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Dough (usually made from flour, water, yeast, salt, and sugar)</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce (made from crushed tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, and herbs)</li>
        <li>Cheese (most commonly mozzarella, but can also include other varieties such as feta, parmesan, gorgonzola)</li>
        <li>Toppings (such as pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, peppers, olives, sausage, bacon, etc.)</li>
        <li>Herbs (such as basil, oregano, thyme)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the dough: Mix the flour, yeast, salt, and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Slowly add water and mix until the dough comes together. Knead the dough for about 10 minutes, or until it becomes smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a towel, and let it rise for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough: Dust a clean surface with flour, and place the dough on it. Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough to the desired thickness (usually about 1/4 inch). Place the dough on a greased baking sheet or pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Add the sauce: Spread tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Add the cheese and toppings: Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce and then add toppings of your choice.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza: Preheat the oven to 425-450°F (220-230°C), and bake the pizza for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven, let it cool for a few minutes, then slice and serve.</li>
